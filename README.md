AI helper - flowers for schools

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My project is an AI helper for schools that recognizes common flowers and plants. Pupils can take a photo of a flower during a walk or in the school garden, and the AI suggests its name and basic facts. It supports outdoor learning, curiosity, and nature education in a fun and interactive way.



## Background

Many pupils and even adults can’t recognize common flowers or plants around them.

Nature education is often limited to textbooks and not connected to real outdoor experiences.

Teachers may lack tools or time to prepare interactive field activities.

My motivation comes from my interest in education and nature. I want to make outdoor learning more engaging and modern.

This topic is important because it supports environmental awareness, observation skills, and curiosity in children — all in a simple and playful way.



## How is it used?

The user opens the mobile app or web tool and takes a photo of a flower or plant they find outdoors — for example, during a nature walk, a school trip, or in the school garden. The AI processes the image and gives an instant suggestion of the plant’s name, a short description, and fun facts (e.g. if it is edible, protected, or has historical use).

This tool is most useful in outdoor learning environments such as:

school yards

parks and forests

botanical gardens

field trips

The main users are:

pupils (especially in primary school)

teachers and educators

nature enthusiasts and families

Needs to consider:
It should be easy to use for children with simple buttons and visual results

The app should work offline or in low-connection areas

It should support local languages and plant species

Privacy: no login or data collection from children





## Challenges

This project does not aim to replace expert knowledge in biology or botany. The plant identification may not always be accurate, especially with poor photo quality or rare species. It should not be used to decide whether a plant is safe to touch or eat. When designing tools for children, privacy and safety must be prioritized — no personal data should be collected, and the app must remain easy to use and understandable. Ecological sensitivity and fairness in training data are also important to avoid cultural bias or promoting invasive species.

## What next?

This project could grow into a full educational app with interactive quizzes, seasonal plant guides, and support for multiple languages. It could also use GPS to show plants common in the local area or let pupils collect badges for plants they find.

To move forward, I would need help from:

a machine learning expert to improve image recognition

a botany teacher or plant expert to verify the content

a designer to make the app child-friendly

developers to build a mobile or web version of the tool

Collaboration with schools or environmental organizations would also help bring the tool into real use.
